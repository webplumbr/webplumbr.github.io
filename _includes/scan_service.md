If you own a vehicle or are planning on purchasing an used vehicle, the ![check engine](/assets/images/check-engine-light-32.png){:title="check engine"} sign shows up on the dashboard of the vehicle for a few seconds when you turn ON the vehicle and vanishes away. This is quite common. At times, the dreaded ![check engine](/assets/images/check-engine-light-32.png){:title="check engine"} sign shows up while the vehicle is running and this indicates there is some sort of issue that the vehicle's computer has detected. This could be a faulty sensor that needs to be replaced, spark plug related issue, or an even more complex mechanical issue.

The ![check engine](/assets/images/check-engine-light-32.png){:title="check engine"} sign cannot be ignored and the cause has to be diagnosed in order to rectify the problem in the vehicle. Dealerships usually charge a fortune to run their diagnostic tool to identify the issue. This is where our service can come in handy as we can drive to your place or you can drive to our place in order to get a diagnostic run and the cause identified.
