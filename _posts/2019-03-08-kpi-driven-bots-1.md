## KPI driven bot: The fledgling bot

This is a fictional series based on my experience working as a web software developer in the Information Technology industry and the day to day impact on various walks of life. KPI driven bot 
is a series that explores how bots (a pun for people) are driven by "key performance indicators" (or better known as KPI) in the industry.

Cucumber is an enthusiastic bot. Fresh out of University and driven to achieve something in life, Cucumber approaches technology with enthusiasm and passion. The downside is, Cucumber does not know when to say “no” or “call it a day”. Cucumber, like many of its peers, is focussed and motivated and probably doesn’t have the distractions of a family bot.

Cucumber joins “The Pulp” company, a startup, and works its arse off in the belief that the product will attract more customers and in turn help the company generate a revenue stream. Cucumber reports to Brinjal bot, who is a no nonsense Engineering manager cum Chief Technology Officer and is an industry veteran. Brinjal bot is hands-on person and has the added machine-learned sense of empathy to understand Cucumber’s position.

Cucumber bot is placed in company of Carrot bot. Carrot bot is what one may call with the marketing word “Rockstar programmer”. Cucumber bot, being the naive bot, believes Carrot bot lives to its reputation as “rockstar” as Carrot bot can belt out code at a rate 10x than other bots and is also puzzled by the strange (read: not very social) behaviour of Carrot bot. Carrot bot has no sense of empathy and is rigid in its expectations of code standards. Being a startup, Brinjal bot realises the need for Carrot bot and has to put up with Carrot bot’s behaviour in spite of knowing it is against team spirit.

Cucumber bot though hurt inside doesn’t understand the intricacies of the industry and the personalities that it will confront in its long career. Cucumber has a great learning experience (read: machine learns) at “The Pulp” company. Cucumber bot learns a wide array of skills that would otherwise not be possible had it joined a major Corporate. It is raised in a risk taking environment and hence doesn’t know the slow-downs due to risk-averse settings. It tries and fails early and gets guided by Brinjal. At times Cucumber is also hesitant to handle tasks relegated to it by Carrot as Carrot’s expectations are rigid and different from that of Brinjal. Cucumber performs well in tasks handed out by Brinjal.

Two years pass by. Cucumber bot has developed a bit of boredom and an aversion working with Carrot bot. “The Pulp” company doesn’t seem to be heading anywhere and unfortunately revenue stream doesn’t seem to be matching projections. Like its peer bots, Cucumber bot decides to make the jump but this time to an established Corporate, named “The Grinder Corp.”.
