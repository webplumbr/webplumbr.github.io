## KPI driven bot: The Grinder Corp.

“The Grinder Corp” is an interesting place. Though it is a Corporate, its internal departments operate like startup units. Cucumber seems a bit dazzled by “The Grinder Corp” campus and the vibe. Lots of chatters about technologies, buzzwords etc… It also sees other bots playing Foosball and Pool on campus. There is even a free vending machine serving these bots.

The Grinder Corp’s chairman bot expects its Corporation to delegate responsibilities to its departments and expects accountability from each and every department. Each and every department has a KPI review for its bots and each bot is meant to prove themselves at each review on why their presence is needed in their department as well as for the Corporation in general. Each bot, at the end of a quarterly KPI review, should be deemed “meeting and exceeding expectations” by their managerial bot. Else, these bots risk the guillotine. 

There is immense psychological pressure on these bots as well as the departments to perform and exceed expectations set at the strategic and departmental level. The Grinder Corp’s chairman in his annual letter to shareholders sets strategic directions of the Company and ensures that the Company will continue to increase quarterly profits and in turn make the shareholders happy.

The lower level bots don’t really get the big picture. They are trained to focus and work and expected to churn out by asking less critical questions. Some higher level bots in the department that joined the Corporation during its early stage had seen their allocated stock prices increase and quit the Company to pastures of their liking. The bots that joined later on post the stock surge and sort of during saturation phase, don’t see much value added to their employee stock purchase program. The bots that joined at the lower rug don’t really care as they are focussed on their limited view tasks. 

In a way, the supply chain setup of pick and replace bots (as a commodity) works really well for “The Grinder Corp”. That is how their departments are able to hire bots based on focussed skillset areas. Meanwhile, Cucumber bot settles down and starts pumping out more code for its department. It reports to Tomato, its line manager.

The line manager's job is to ensure its bots meet their quarterly KPIs.
