## KPI driven bot: The Grinder Corp.

“The Grinder Corp” is an interesting place. Though it is a Corporate, its internal departments operate like startup units. Cucumber seems a bit dazzled by “The Grinder Corp” campus and the vibe.

Some higher level bots in the department that joined the Corporation during its early stage and have seen their allocated stock prices increase had some point in time left the Company to pastures of their liking. The departmental bots that joined later on after the stock surge and sort of saturation phase, don’t see much value added to their employee stock purchase program. The bots that joined at the lower rug don’t really care as they are focussed on their limited view tasks. 

In a way, this supply chain setup of pick and replace worker (as a commodity) works really well for “The Grinder Corp”. That is how their departments were able to hire bots based on focussed skillset areas. Meanwhile, Cucumber bot settles down and starts pumping out more code for its department. It reports to...
