# The Who

> Hi! This is Prasanna (a.k.a Webplumbr). 

I am an experienced web applications developer with site operations background, offering solutions and quality technical support for business and community needs. I am presently based out of Sydney, Australia.

I like solving technical problems and these days I enjoy sharing my learned 
experience with Junior members of the team. It is hard to limit myself to a 
"titled role" as I believe it is essential to understand the business problem 
(from a bird's eye view) in order to arrive at a technical solution (specifics) 
that would be appropriate in solving the problem.

With modern technology tools and stack, most of the times the problem would have 
been faced by someone else and it is a matter of checking if a tool or library 
exists already. Now, how it is implemented and other considerations come with 
experience. I advocate less complicated frameworks or implementations that follow 
a pattern and offers predictable and repeatable approach in solving a problem.

> I enjoy working in progressive minded places that value human relationship. I am committed to what I undertake and thrive well in supportive environment.

I have worked across different sized Companies, profit and non-profit, and 
across economies, developed ones such as US of A, New Zealand, Australia 
 and developing ones such as India. So, I am quite comfortable working in a 
 multi-cultural setup.
 
> I am a person with multi-faceted interests. 

I enjoy unlearning things from kids, writing about life experience, motorcycle 
rides, DIY fixes, movies etc. This keeps me engaged and helps me draw inspiration 
from different walks of life.

# The What

Working with web has helped me accumulate certain skills over the years. Some might 
not be relevant in terms of today's development yet the experience learnt still 
applies. Some relevant technology skills:

{% assign tools = page.tools | sort %}
{% for tool in tools %}<span class="tool">{{ tool }}</span> {% endfor %}
 
# The Where

I enjoy investigating technical issues, liaising with teams, interacting with end-users, participating in product iteration based on customer feedback, automating repetitive tasks, analysing and interpreting data. 

# Contact

Currently I'm <span class="sign-board">closed</span> for new opportunities.
