# The Who

> Hi! This is Prasanna (a.k.a Webplumbr). 

I am an experienced web applications 
developer with site operations background, offering solutions for business and 
community needs. I am presently based out of Sydney, Australia.

I like solving technical problems and these days I enjoy sharing my learned 
experience with Junior members of the team. It is hard to limit myself to a 
"titled role" as I believe it is essential to understand the business problem 
(from a bird's eye view) in order to arrive at a technical solution (specifics) 
that would be appropriate in solving the problem.

With modern technology tools and stack, most of the times the problem would have 
been faced by someone else and it is a matter of checking if a tool or library 
exists already. Now, how it is implemented and other considerations come with 
experience. I advocate less complicated frameworks or implementations that follow 
a pattern and offers predictable and repeatable approach in solving a problem.

These days, I prefer a work-life balance in order to focus and spend time with 
my family. So, please keep this in mind before you consider me for a role. That 
said, I am committed to what I undertake and thrive well in environment that 
has less layers of fat and a consideration for basic human values.

I have worked across different sized Companies, profit and non-profit, and 
across economies, developed ones such as US of A, New Zealand, Australia 
 and developing ones such as India. So, I am quite comfortable working in a 
 multi-cultural setup.
 
> I am a person with multi-faceted interests. 

I enjoy unlearning things from kids, writing about life experience, motorcycle 
rides, DIY fixes, movies etc. This keeps me engaged and helps me draw inspiration 
from different walks of life.

# The What

Working with web has helped me accumulate certain skills over the years. Some might 
not be relevant in terms of today's development yet the experience learnt still 
applies. Some relevant technology skills:

{% assign tools = page.tools | sort %}
{% for tool in tools %}<span class="tool">{{ tool }}</span> {% endfor %}
 
# The Where

I enjoy automating tasks, analysing and interpreting data, and overall 
product ownership. I see myself heading in that direction in near future. Engaging 
and talking to end-users on how they use the product offers vital clue on how the 
product is being perceived outside of the factory (i.e. development team). Understanding 
this helps in prioritising product issues and help improve product offering and 
visibility.

# Contact

If you are a recruiter, try to read and ensure if I would be a good fit for the Company 
that will eventually pay you for your Services. End of the day, it isn't about just 
technology tools match. For a longer relationship, I think, the overall picture matters. 

That said, I am open towards long-term contracts across Companies or full-time role in a 
place that factors in holistic development.

Currently I'm <span class="sign-board">open</span> for new opportunities.
